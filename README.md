## Installation

You can install this theme on [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/styles/174119/exercism-dark).

You need a browser addon for this. I recommend Stylus ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/de/extensions/details/stylus/)).

After installing the theme, go to _settings_ â†’ _preferences_ and enable the **dark code theme**.
