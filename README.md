## Installation

You can install this theme on [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/styles/174119/exercism-dark).

You need a browser addon for this. I recommend Stylus ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/de/extensions/details/stylus/)).

After installing the theme, go to _settings_ â†’ _preferences_ and enable the **dark code theme**.

## I'm open for suggestions

## Please report bugs!

Possible bugs include:

- invisible text with the same color as the background
- text, images and icons with too little contrast
- clickable elements that should change color when hovered, but don't
- ugly white lines and areas
- anything that looks ugly, or is inconsistent

1. Download this repository and edit the colors in [style/variables.scss](style/variables.scss).
